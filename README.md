# Capstone-Retrieving-Processing-and-Visualizing-Data-with-Python

Creates a chart comparing US covid-19 deaths with other top causes of death.  

Uses the following manually downloaded datasets:

+ https://healthdata.gov/dataset/united-states-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-state-over-time
+ https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html

Execute runall.py to view the chart.

Note: I had originally planned to download the data programmatically via the REST interface,
but for various technical and data download policy reasons it was quicker to do it manually.
