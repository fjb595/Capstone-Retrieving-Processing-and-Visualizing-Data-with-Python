Messages:
"1. When you group results by 15 Leading Causes, results are initially ordered by Death counts; also, total rows, zero rows,"
"suppressed rows, and Percent of Total are not available. Click any green up/down arrow to change the order. #Top15#"

Caveats:
"1. When you group results by 15 Leading Causes, results show the top 15 rankable causes for the query criteria. Rankable causes"
"are a subset of the ICD 113 and ICD 130 (Infants) Cause Lists. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Top15."
"2. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,"
"due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#NotApplicableRates."
